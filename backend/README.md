# Backend (Laravel) â€” Skeleton

This folder contains skeleton files for the Laravel backend: models, migrations, controllers, services, an artisan command and a Dockerfile.

To create a runnable Laravel app here, run inside this folder:
1. composer create-project laravel/laravel .
2. composer require laravel/sanctum guzzlehttp/guzzle
3. Copy these skeleton files into the created Laravel project (they are already here).
4. Update .env, run php artisan key:generate and php artisan migrate.
